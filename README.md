#Project Details

This project is an inventory management system implemented in Rust. It allows users to add, remove, update, and display items in an inventory. Each item in the inventory is represented by a unique ID, name, description, quantity, and price. Users can interact with the system through a command-line interface, where they are presented with a menu to perform various operations on the inventory. The system ensures data integrity by validating user input and providing error messages for invalid inputs. It utilizes Rust's strong type system and error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability. Overall, the project provides a simple yet effective solution for managing inventory in small-scale applications, suitable for businesses or individuals needing a lightweight and efficient inventory management solution.
